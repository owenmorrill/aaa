From the Snyk console, you can view the imported project from your last pipeline run. Each identified vulnerability will include a [**Priority Score**](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-priority-score/) as well as [**Fix advice**](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006113798-Remediate-your-vulnerabilities) to help you proactively address security concerns.
