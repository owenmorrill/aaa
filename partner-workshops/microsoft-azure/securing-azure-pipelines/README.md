# Securing Azure Pipelines

### Welcome

This workshop builds upon the **Securing AKS,** **Securing ACR, & Securing Azure Repos** modules which provided you with sample patterns and reference architectures for securing [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) workloads with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/). Now, we will extend that learning and cover scanning of source code in [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/repos/). Microsoft Azure Repos is part of [Microsoft Azure DevOps Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/devops/). We will provide you with step-by-step examples and sample code that will walk you through deployment of supporting infrastructure, sample applications, and configuration of the various Snyk integrations to Microsoft Azure.

In order to complete the exercises in this workshop, you will need a [Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) & [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) account. You can use the content in this module either as a continuation of the previous workshops or as a stand-alone example of how to integrate Snyk with Azure Pipelines.
