Snyk integrates seamlessly with AWS CodePipeline to scan your application for open source security vulnerabilities and help you deliver secure applications via continuous delivery service. This integration allows CodePipeline users to make security an automated part of their build, test, and deploy phases.

You can read more about the integration in our [blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/automate-vulnerability-scanning-in-aws-codepipeline-with-snyk/) as well as our [product documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/4402158184081-AWS-CodePipeline-integration) page. Additional details are available in the AWS CodePipeline User Guide under [Snyk action structure reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-Snyk.html).

The following labs are intended to provide customers with a step-by-step guide to enable and use this integration.
